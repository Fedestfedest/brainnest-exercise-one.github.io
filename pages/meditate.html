        <h1>Meditate</h1>
        <p>When I need to have another perspective about things I really love having a time of relax. Sometimes in those times of relax 
            I can start to meditate. I think there are different types of meditations but I just try to clear my mind of my preocupations 
            and find another perspective of things. This really help me when I have to take important decitions.</p>
