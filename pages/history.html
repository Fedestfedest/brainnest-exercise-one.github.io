        <h1>Study History</h1>
        <p>I really love studying history because there is so much we can learn about it. I realized that in the past were a lot of 
            inteligent people in the intelectual, filosofical and spiritual way. I think that currently we can learn much from this people 
            and the situtations they experienced.</p>
